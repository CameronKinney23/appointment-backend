<strong>Cameron Kinney's Computer Science Capstone Project</strong>

This repository contains the backend logic, database schema, and email notification system developed for my senior capstone project in Computer Science. The project supports a real-world appointment scheduling interface and demonstrates production-grade engineering across API design, data validation, and backend-to-user communication. I built the system using FastAPI for lightweight routing, PostgreSQL for scalable data storage, and SQLAlchemy to define clean, relational models. Input and output validation is handled through Pydantic schemas, ensuring type safety and predictable API responses. I used Postman to test each endpoint, confirming that data flowed correctly and edge cases were handled gracefully. To enhance user experience, I integrated SendGrid to deliver automated email notifications upon successful appointment submission. The backend is deployed to Render, with environment variables securely managing credentials and connection strings.
Key files in this repository include main.py for route definitions, models.py for database schema, schemas.py for validation logic, crud.py for core operations, email_utils.py for email integration, and test_routes.py for backend reliability testing. The repository also includes a Postman collection for endpoint validation and screenshots that document each enhancement phase. These include the original and enhanced “Where to Find Us” page, the final appointment form interface, and proof of email notification delivery. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and deploy a full-stack system that is secure, scalable, and user-focused.
You can explore the backend code in this repository, view the live deployment on Render, and access my full ePortfolio on GitHub Pages, which includes all enhancement narratives, screenshots, and my professional self-assessment.
