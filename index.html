  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
  <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and prepare to enter the field with confidence...</p>

  <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
  <p>Phase 1 of this capstone focused on translating client requirements into a responsive, accessible, and conversion-focused Appointments page. After meeting with the company, I designed a Liquid template that aligned with their business goals and user expectations. The layout emphasized clarity and ease of use, guiding users through the booking process with intuitive form fields and semantic structure. I ensured that every frontend element mapped cleanly to backend logic, reducing friction and improving reliability. This phase laid the foundation for backend integration and demonstrated my ability to deliver polished, user-centered design in a real-world engineering context.</p>

  <p>Below are screenshots showing the original and enhanced versions of the Appointments page:</p>
