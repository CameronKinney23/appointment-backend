  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
  <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and prepare to enter the field with confidence...</p>

  <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
  <p>Phase 1 of this capstone focused on translating client requirements into a responsive, accessible, and conversion-focused Appointments page. After meeting with the company, I designed a Liquid template that aligned with their business goals and user expectations. The layout emphasized clarity and ease of use, guiding users through the booking process with intuitive form fields and semantic structure. I ensured that every frontend element mapped cleanly to backend logic, reducing friction and improving reliability. This phase laid the foundation for backend integration and demonstrated my ability to deliver polished, user-centered design in a real-world engineering context.</p>

  <p>Below are screenshots showing the original and enhanced versions of the Appointments page:</p>

  <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
  <p>Phase 2 focused on building the backend logic that powers the Appointments system. I developed a scheduling algorithm that validates time slots, prevents overlaps, and enforces business rules like future-only bookings and no double-booking. I also implemented backend form validation to ensure clean, reliable data—checking for required fields, proper formats, and logical constraints before any data reaches the database.</p>

  <p>To structure and sanitize input/output, I used Pydantic schemas that enforce type safety and make API responses predictable. I also built custom error handling with descriptive messages and HTTP status codes, improving both developer experience and frontend integration. This phase demonstrated my ability to translate abstract rules into executable logic and reinforced my commitment to clean, testable backend engineering.</p>

  <h2>Database Design and Deployment</h2>
  <p>Phase 3 focused on building and deploying a production-grade PostgreSQL database to support the Appointments system. I designed a scalable schema using SQLAlchemy models, defining fields for user input, timestamps, and status flags. This structure ensured data integrity and clean relationships between entities.</p>

  <p>I deployed the database to Render and configured environment variables to securely manage credentials and connection strings. This allowed real-time appointment logging and retrieval from the frontend. I also implemented full CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, Delete—through FastAPI endpoints, validating inputs and handling edge cases like duplicates and missing fields.</p>

  <p>To ensure reliability, I tested database interactions with isolated routes and unit tests, confirming that data persisted correctly and errors were handled gracefully. This phase demonstrated my ability to architect and deploy backend infrastructure that’s secure, scalable, and ready for production.</p>
