  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
  <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and prepare to enter the field with confidence...</p>

  <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
  <p>Phase 1 of this capstone focused on direct client collaboration to identify and implement meaningful website enhancements. After scheduling and conducting an in-person meeting with the company, I gathered feedback on user pain points and business goals. The most impactful change was replacing the generic "Shop All" page with a tailored "Where to Find Us" section. This new page includes an embedded Instagram video with visual instructions, clickable Apple and Google Maps links to the store, and a tap-to-call phone number for immediate contact. This enhancement improved user navigation, boosted local engagement, and aligned the site more closely with the company’s real-world customer flow.</p>

  <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
  <p>Phase 2 focused on building the backend logic that powers the Appointments system. I developed a scheduling algorithm that validates time slots, prevents overlaps, and enforces business rules like future-only bookings and no double-booking. I also implemented backend form validation to ensure clean, reliable data—checking for required fields, proper formats, and logical constraints before any data reaches the database.</p>

  <p>To structure and sanitize input/output, I used Pydantic schemas that enforce type safety and make API responses predictable. I also built custom error handling with descriptive messages and HTTP status codes, improving both developer experience and frontend integration. This phase demonstrated my ability to translate abstract rules into executable logic and reinforced my commitment to clean, testable backend engineering.</p>

  <h2>Database Design and Deployment</h2>
  <p>Phase 3 focused on building and deploying a production-grade PostgreSQL database to support the Appointments system. I designed a scalable schema using SQLAlchemy models, defining fields for user input, timestamps, and status flags. This structure ensured data integrity and clean relationships between entities.</p>

  <p>I deployed the database to Render and configured environment variables to securely manage credentials and connection strings. This allowed real-time appointment logging and retrieval from the frontend. I also implemented full CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, Delete—through FastAPI endpoints, validating inputs and handling edge cases like duplicates and missing fields.</p>

  <p>To ensure reliability, I tested database interactions with isolated routes and unit tests, confirming that data persisted correctly and errors were handled gracefully. This phase demonstrated my ability to architect and deploy backend infrastructure that’s secure, scalable, and ready for production.</p>
